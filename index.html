            <p class="ramblegraph"> Light blinds us as we look into the scorching sun. We see flares come off that sun and in <br>
            the end what do we gain but more blind and shallow eyes. The eyes of defeated men by the <br>
            light. The light we hold dear and the light we seek is also coincidentally the light that hurts that <br>
            stings. Bees are the way of life, the way we live. Bees are the humming of cars around us and <br>
            the beating wings of the hive as we the bees of the world work on progress. For the hive we <br>
            hunt and seek knowledge, for the hive we look to the sky and seek that golden star that we hold <br>
            so dear. It is this mission we complete for the fulfillment of the soul. Spirit is the heart beating for <br>
            the cause. Spirit is the way we continue through this dark and treacherous gap of life and death <br>
            our spirit walks and it is then that we look to the heavens and ask for relief we ask for our spirit <br>
            to be free. In this mission we seek the laws of our soul that guide the very existence of the self. <br>
            Our lives are specks in this world and understanding is all but null to the gods. Our existence <br>
            repeats again and again over and over. <a class="looplink" href="sheep.html">Is this a loop?</a></p>
